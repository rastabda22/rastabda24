## Jerboa TTS

A simple Text Terminal Simulator for Javascript.

This was the prototype (aptly named 'Terminal.html' at the time) and uses a 'pre' tag and draws on it with Javascript.  
Aside from being a functional example, it's quite limited since we can only edit settings through the CSS properties of the objects.  
This was the last version (6).

Since I decided to go on a different direction (use a 'canvas' tag) from then on I won't be updating it any further.  
You can move the player (depicted by an **@** character) with the cursor keys.
