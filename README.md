## Jerboa TTS

A simple Text Terminal Simulator for Javascript.

It uses the 'canvas' tag and manages a View (represents the canvas as a Grid) and a Grid (the actual contents of the Terminal).  
This combination is superior to the prototype which used the 'pre' tag as it allows for full control over it since the Grid is copied to the View/canvas per frame.

You can move the player (depicted by an **☻** character) with the cursor keys.
